# Caesar Cipher

A simple Python implementation of the Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption algorithm. This was created as part of my internship project.

## 🔐 What is Caesar Cipher?

The Caesar Cipher is a basic encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

Example:
- Plaintext: `HELLO`
- Shift: `3`
- Ciphertext: `KHOOR`
